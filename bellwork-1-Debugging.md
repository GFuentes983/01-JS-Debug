Please describe in detail your feelings about where you currently are in JavaScript programming. Please include how well you feel that you have mastered it, as well as listing those things that you think are a challenge to you. Any feedback about whre you are, and where you think you need to go, or would like to go, will be very helpful in getting you there.

I am confident that I can program something correctly with instructions, without instruction it may be a little more time consuming as I'll and tinker to figure out a solution or a way to do what was asked. I have mastered the barebones real basic stuff such as loops, variables, and functions. Things that may be challenging would be making and programming JavaScript from scratch to make something. I would like to be able to easily program from scratch. 

Please describe in detail the types of "bugs" a coder can expect to encounter when coding a web page with JavaScript. Describe the techniques you have learned to resolve the types of bugs that we have examined so far. Quote an outside source containing information on resolving this type of bug.

Some bugs that a coder may run into while coding with JavaScript is Logic, Syntax and Run-time bugs; Some techniques to resolve or find these bugs is using the console and logging certain blocks of code. Clawson mentioned that when debugging searching for spelling mistakes is what to check for first

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the difference between syntax bugs and logic bugs. Describe the differences in technique in the way that they are resolved. Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

The difference between syntax and logic bugs is that a syntax bug is you mess up the code itself like missing a set of quotes or parentheses. A logic bug on the other hand can have nothing wrong with syntax but because of how it was programmed it can create issues such as wrong numbers or operators.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the three different techniques that we have learned so far to resolve logic bugs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?  For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

3 different ways to resolve logic bugs are: check for console errors, check numbers and operators in function or condition that isn't working correctly, use console logging to see where the bugs occurs. Each has the advantage of systematically finding the error or bugs. The disadvantages is that using these methods may take longer than other options.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what we can use a debugger for and how it is used. For what types of situations is a debugger the best choice for resolving bugs? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a debugger?  For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

A debugger is something like developer tools that allows you find more easily where bugs show up and what might cause them. The advantages is being more efficient at finding and fixing bugs. However it becomes less and less useful the more complex a bug might be.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the four JavaScript key words that are used for Exception Handling. Briefly describe the purpose of each. What are the advantages of the using the techniques of Exception Handling in your coding? For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

try, catch, throw and finally are JS keywords that are used for Exception Handling. Try tries a code of block for bugs by running it, Catch lets you handle an error, Throw allows you to customize the error and Finally lets you execute code regardless of the result.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what you think are the most important take-aways that you got from the unit on debugging techniques. How will these techniques help you be successful in your coding? For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Important things to use when degugging are the dev tools, console logs, and more console commands. These ways of debugging help us be successful in coding by allowing us to locate and fix errors and bugs that occur when coding.
