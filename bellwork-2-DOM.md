Please describe in detail, in your own words, what is event-driven programming. Is JavaScript event-driven? What is an event on a computer? What is an event handler? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Event driven programming is a type of programming that uses things like user input, timers and conditions to run programs or actions. JavaScript can be event driven. An event on a computer is user input and timers. "https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~mesterharm/2350/event.html"

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what is the Document Object Model (DOM). What is its purpose? What is its structure? What are some of the differences in the DOM between different browsers? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

The Document Object Model is a template of sorts used to progress down a hierarchy of files to be able to target and change certain objects that are in a document. Some differences in DOM's used on browsers may be things like ease of access or accessibility in the hierarchy. "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what are the methods of the document object that enable you to retrieve elements from the DOM so that you may manipulate them. What is the best use for each method? What does it return? What are some of the things that may be done with an element that you have retrieved from the DOM? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Methods that allow you to traverse the DOM are methods that are like getElementById or querySelector. The best use for methods that use get are for changing the content or styles of a specific element while using query is more commonly used for arrays of elements.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what is the process by which you may create an element in JavaScript. What is a child element? How does one add the element to the DOM? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

The process to create an element in JavaScript is using a method called createElement() you need to create the element by having it be stored as a variable. After you created the element you need to now add it to the document by referencing the variable as something to be added into the document. A child element is the element that is subclassed under another element (parent element) that is higher in the hierarchy.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what is the process by which you may create a document fragment in JavaScript. How does one add the document fragment to the DOM? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

The process to create a document fragment is much like creating elements in JavaScript just minus a step. You store an element you created in a variable and that is now a document fragment. To add the document fragment to the DOM you would need to reference the variable as something to be added into DOM. 

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what is the process by which you may remove nodes from the DOM in JavaScript. How does this affect any child elements of the element removed? May the removed element be retained in memory for further use? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter. 

Please describe in detail, in your own words, how you would go about manipulating a button in JavaScript to take a new action, on the same event, instead of the previous action it has taken. Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the various methods of the window object that may be used to work with multiple browser windows. Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, exactly what the DOM screen object and its methods may be used for. What advantages does it give to the programmer when the result is to support multiple size screen view ports? Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.
